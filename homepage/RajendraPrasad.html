        <p>Dr. Rajendra Prasad, often referred to as Rajendra Babu, was an Indian political leader, lawyer, and statesman who played a significant role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. While he is primarily known for his contribution to the Indian independence movement, he also made significant contributions to the shaping of India as its first President. </p>
        <p>Born on December 3, 1884, in Zeradei village, Bihar, Rajendra Prasad received his early education in Patna and later pursued higher studies in Calcutta (now Kolkata). He completed his education in law from the University of Calcutta and established a successful legal practice. </p>
        <p>Dr. Prasad's involvement in the freedom movement began during his student days when he joined the Indian National Congress (INC). He actively participated in various agitations and campaigns against British colonial rule. He gained prominence as a leader and became a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. </p>
        <p>Prasad participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922), Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934), and the Quit India Movement (1942), all of which aimed to challenge British authority and secure India's independence. He was frequently arrested and imprisoned for his involvement in these movements. </p>
        <p> Post-independence, Dr. Rajendra Prasad played a crucial role in the framing of the Indian Constitution. He served as the President of the Constituent Assembly and was elected as the President of India when the country became a republic in 1950. He was subsequently re-elected for two more terms and served as the President until 1962, making him the longest-serving President of India.</p>
        <p> During his presidency, Dr. Prasad worked towards strengthening democratic institutions and upholding the values of the Indian Constitution. He was known for his simplicity, integrity, and commitment to the welfare of the people. After his presidency, he retired from active politics and spent the remaining years of his life in seclusion.</p>
     <p>
        Dr. Rajendra Prasad is widely respected and regarded as one of the founding fathers of the Indian Republic. His contributions to the freedom struggle and nation-building efforts have earned him a place of reverence in Indian history.
