<p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement and a renowned leader of nonviolent resistance. He is often referred to as the "Father of the Nation" in India. Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, Gandhi played a crucial role in India's struggle for freedom from British colonial rule.
    <p>Gandhi's approach to activism was centered around the principle of nonviolence, which he called "Satyagraha." He believed in the power of truth and love to bring about social and political change. Through methods such as civil disobedience, peaceful protests, and fasting, he aimed to awaken the conscience of both the British rulers and the Indian people.
        <p>Gandhi advocated for various causes during his lifetime, including the fight against racial discrimination, social inequality, and poverty. He was a staunch supporter of Hindu-Muslim unity and worked tirelessly to bridge communal divides. Gandhi emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and encouraged Indians to adopt a simple lifestyle and practice swadeshi (using locally made products) to promote economic independence.
            <p>One of Gandhi's most notable campaigns was the Salt March in 1930, where he led thousands of Indians on a 240-mile journey to protest against the British salt monopoly. This act of civil disobedience captured international attention and became a symbol of India's fight for independence.
                <p>Gandhi's philosophy and leadership inspired millions of people around the world, and his influence extended far beyond India's struggle for freedom. His principles of nonviolence and peaceful resistance continue to be used in various movements for social justice and human rights globally.
                    <p>Sadly, Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist who disagreed with Gandhi's views on interreligious harmony. However, his legacy lives on, and he is remembered as one of the most influential and revered figures in history, symbolizing the power of peaceful resistance and the pursuit of truth and justice.
